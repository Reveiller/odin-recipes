        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Shanghai nian gao style is usually packaged in a thick soft rod to be sliced up or packaged pre-sliced and either stir-fried or added to soup. Depending on the cooking method, this style is a soft to a chewy variant. The Shanghai style keeps the nian gao white, and made with non-glutinous rice. The color is its distinct feature.</p>
        <p>When served as a dish, the most common is the stir-fry method, hence the name (炒年糕, chǎo nián gāo). There are three general types. The first is a savory dish, common ingredients include scallions, beef, pork, cabbage, Chinese cabbage etc. The second is a sweet version using standard white sugar. The last version is taste-less, and is often consumed for its chewy textures.</p>
        <p>This recipe will be for the first type.</p>

            <li>Portion out how much nian gao you want and set aside in a bowl with water to soak.</li>

            <li>Pour a small amount of oil into a wok or pan.</li>
            <li>Turn on heat and set to high.</li>
            <li>After a couple minutes, put meat in and cook until outside seared, but not cooked all the way through.</li>
